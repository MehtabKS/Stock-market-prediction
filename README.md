# Stock-market-prediction
Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit.

The objective of this project is to be able to predict stock market trends using machine learning capabilities and help its users make informed decisions to invest money in the stock market. Machine learning can provide valuable
insights and improve the accuracy of financial forecasts. The Stock Market Prediction Web Application is aimed at providing users with a platform for making informed investment decisions in the stock market.
The application will use Long term short memory (LSTM) network, which is a recurrent neural network (RNN), aimed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem present in traditional RNNs and help predict the stock market by
dividing the obtained historical data into 70% training part and 30% testing part.
The main objectives of this project are:
 
 • To develop a user-friendly web application that predicts stock
market prices based on historical data and relevant factors.

 • To offer insights and recommendations to users to help them make
informed investment choices.

 • To implement long short term memory machine learning (LSTM)
Model for stock price prediction.

• To enhance the understanding of stock market dynamics through
data visualization and analytics.
